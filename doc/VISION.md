# Vision and directions for Shaltúre (draft)

Inspired by the discontinuation of Atheme development, Shaltúre aims
to eventually provide a suitable successor that may be used by networks
interested in an Atheme-style services package.

Compatibility with Atheme is typically desirable, but will have to yield
to improvement in cases where these two virtues conflict. To ensure easy
adoption by networks previously using Atheme, migration has to be kept
as simple as possible, however.

Functionality-wise, consistency and the ability to fulfill users' needs
are important goals. Code-wise, abstraction is a highly desirable goal
that should allow for improved user-facing consistency as well.
