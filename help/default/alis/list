Help for LIST:

LIST gives a list of channels matching the
pattern, modified by the other options.

Syntax: LIST <pattern> [options]

Options are:
    -min <n>: show only channels with at least <n> users
    -max <n>: show only channels with at most <n> users
    -skip <n>: skip first <n> matches
    -show [m][t]: show modes/topicsetter
    -mode <+|-|=><modes>: modes set/unset/equal
    -topic <pattern>: topic matches pattern
    -showsecret: show secret channels (requires chan:auspex)
    
The pattern can contain * and ? wildcards. The pattern has to
match the full channel name or a full topic, depending on where it 
is used; the wildcards are important. For example, from most to 
least specific:
 bar        - exactly "bar" without any characters preceding or 
              following it (matches no channel names)
 ?bar       - any character followed by "bar"
 #bar*      - anything starting with "#bar" 
 ##*bar*    - anything starting with ## and containing "bar"
 *cows*moo* - anything containing "cows", 0 or more characters, and "moo"
 *bar*      - anything containing "bar"

Examples:
    /msg &nick& LIST *seachterm*
    /msg &nick& LIST * -topic *seachterm*
    /msg &nick& LIST * -min 50
    /msg &nick& LIST #foo*
    /msg &nick& LIST -mode =n #foo*
    /msg &nick& LIST -mode -t *freetopic* -show mt
    /msg &nick& LIST -mode +c ##nocolors* -show t
